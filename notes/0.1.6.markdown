# Sbt plug-in [Best Practices][bp] compliant.

After much trial and error a new set of best practices were layed out including those that affect
how you access coffeescripted keys.

- no more coffee:<tab>

Away went the Coffee config and in comes the coffee scoped tasks

Below is a diagram to help you transition over to the new style of accessing keys

    coffee                 -> coffee
    coffee:clean           -> clean(for coffee) or (clean in coffee)
    coffee:sources         -> sources(for coffee) or (sources in coffee)
    coffee:sourceDirectory -> source-directory(for coffee) or (sourceDirectory in coffee)
    coffee:filter          -> filter
    coffee:excludeFilter   -> excludeFilter(for coffee) or (excludeFilter in coffee)
    coffee:targetDirectory -> resourceManaged(for coffee) or (resourceManaged in coffee)
    coffee:bare            -> bare(for coffee) or (bare in coffee)
    coffee:charset         -> charset(for coffee) or (charset in coffee)

This new style should promote better reuse of built-in keys and more flexibility in terms of
`Config`ureabilty.

To include coffeescripted's settings within your build's default configs, use

    seq(coffeeSettings:_*)

To include coffeescripted's setting with your build in a target config, use

    seq(coffeeSettingsIn(TargetConfig):_*)

- Keys have their own module, `CoffeeKeys`.

To override a coffeescripted key, access them through the `CoffeeKeys` moule

    (CoffeeKeys.bar in CoffeeKeys.coffee) := true
