# Sbt plug-in [Best Practices][bp] compliant.

After much trial and error a new set of best practices were layed out including those that affect
how you access coffeescripted keys.

- no more coffee:<tab>

Away went the Coffee config and in comes the coffee scoped tasks

Below is a diagram to help you transition over to the new style of accessing keys

    coffee                 -> coffee
    coffee:clean           -> some-config:clean(for coffee)            or (clean in (SomeConfig, coffee))
    coffee:sources         -> unmanaged-sources(for coffee)            or (unmanagedSources in (SomeConfig,coffee))
    coffee:sourceDirectory -> some-config:source-directory(for coffee) or (sourceDirectory in (SomeConfig, coffee))
    coffee:filter          -> filter(for coffee)                       or (filter in (SomeConfig, coffee))
    coffee:excludeFilter   -> exclude-filter(for coffee)               or (excludeFilter in (SomeConfig, coffee))
    coffee:targetDirectory -> some-config:resource-managed(for coffee) or (resourceManaged in (SomeConfig, coffee))
    coffee:bare            -> bare(for coffee)                         or (bare in (SomeConfig, coffee))
    coffee:charset         -> charset(for coffee)                      or (charset in (SomeConfig, coffee))

This new style should promote better reuse of built-in keys and more flexibility in terms of
`Config`ureabilty.

To include coffeescripted's settings within your build's default configs, use

    seq(coffeeSettings:_*)

To include coffeescripted's setting with your build in a target config, use

    seq(coffeeSettingsIn(TargetConfig):_*)

- Keys have their own module, `CoffeeKeys`.

To override a coffeescripted key, access them through the `CoffeeKeys` module

    (CoffeeKeys.bare in CoffeeKeys.coffee) := true
