[CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) source compilation for [sbt 0.10.0](http://typesafe.artifactoryonline.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-tools.sbt/sbt-launch/0.10.0/sbt-launch.jar) and beyond

* fixed issues with nested CoffeeScript source directories
* actual error handling
* prefer a managed resource output path
* made better use of sbt 0.10.0 idioms
* don't share reference to CoffeeScript compiler

### Basic use

Add `coffeescripted-sbt` to your plugin chain

    cat foo/project/plugins/build.sbt

    resolvers += "less is" at "http://repo.lessis.me"

    libraryDependencies += "me.lessis" %% "coffeescripted-sbt" % "0.1.1"

This will put the tasks `coffee` and `coffee-clean` in scope.

The plugin can be customized by changing the settings `coffee-source`, `coffee-target` and `coffee-bare`.
